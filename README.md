## Report Components & Analysis

The final report is a complete set of financial statements, including:

1.  **Income Statement:** Details the company's revenues and expenses, arriving at a Net Profit of ₹1,40,000.
2.  **Balance Sheet:** Presents the company's financial position at year-end, showing Total Assets of ₹2,40,000 balanced by Liabilities and Equity.
3.  **Statement of Changes in Equity:** Links the Income Statement to the Balance Sheet by detailing the changes in Owner's Capital and Retained Earnings (including a calculated dividend payment of ₹87,000).
4.  **Cash Flow Statement (Indirect Method):** Reconciles the accrual-based Net Income to the final cash balance, breaking down cash movements into Operating, Investing, and Financing activities.
5.  **Notes to the Financial Statements:** Provides crucial context by explaining the accounting policies used (e.g., accrual basis, depreciation) and the key assumptions made.


## Skills Demonstrated
